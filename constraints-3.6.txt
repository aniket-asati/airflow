# This constraints file was automatically generated on 2022-03-30T07:11:01Z
# via "eager-upgrade" mechanism of PIP. For the "v2-2-test" branch of Airflow.
# This variant of constraints install uses the HEAD of the branch version for 'apache-airflow' but installs
# the providers from PIP-released packages at the moment of the constraint generation.
#
# Those constraints are actually those that regular users use to install released version of Airflow.
# We also use those constraints after "apache-airflow" is released and the constraints are tagged with
# "constraints-X.Y.Z" tag to build the production image for that version.
